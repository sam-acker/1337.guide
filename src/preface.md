> *"Why be a hacker?"*

Apart from the obvious (IT’S COOL), there are many hackers that hack with malicious intent. We call them attackers or threat actors in the professional world. They can be cyber criminals going after profit at the expense of others, Nation states conducting intelligence operations or cyber warfare, or even so-called “hacktivists” who hack for a cause. These attackers cost the world approx. $X per year (as of 20XX). Because of this, there is an increasingly growing need for those who choose to hack for good (known as “white hats” or ethical hackers). Security professionals with the same skills as the attackers who can attack their own organizations first to discover and fix weaknesses before the real threat actors take advantage of them. Yes, the world wants YOU to be a hacker.

>*“Ok, so I want to become one… but how?”*

To the uninitiated, hacking is a term which is shrouded in mystery. To many beginners without understanding it simply conjures images of figures like Neo or a young John Connor exhibiting arcane digital magic; typing fast before proclaiming 'I'm in'. To tell the truth, we hackers have a great love for the mystique surrounding our craft (and will never get tired of watching Zero Cool doing absolutely impossible nonsense), but it’s actually not a supernatural ability despite common conceptions. In reality, it is simply clever engineering and anyone with a passion and dedication for understanding computer systems can become a hacker.

## Conceptions of Hacking

There are 3 important conceptions of hacking, the first is what we call the “fundamental” conception because it describes what hacking actually is in the simplest possible terms. 

| Fundamental: | Hacking is the abuse of an input output system. Hacking involves sending input to a system in order to get output from the system that the designer did not intend. |
|-------------|-----|

Reductive yes, but accurate. Think of your car as a system. If you send the “input” of pressing on the gas pedal something will happen inside the system (the fuel will ignite in the engine) and the output is that your wheels turn faster. Imagine if you could press the pedal in a special way that would cause something else to happen, like maybe the hood opening. To give a direct digital example, think of your web browser as a system. You can give input to it in the form of website names in the URL bar. What if you could enter something other than a website name, or some specially formatted website name, that caused your browser to do something other than what the software engineers intended it to do?

The second conception of hacking we call the “motivational” conception because it describes the areas of opportunity in a target of a hacker and what the hacker ultimately wants to accomplish. 

| Motivational: | The area of a target that is exposed to hacker risk is anywhere they have a need to provide software/hardware access to either internal employees or external customers. Hackers aim to either disrupt that software/hardware or steal data from it. |
|-------------|-----|


| Functional: | In order to be the most effective hacker possible for a given target you must understand the system plus the underlying architecture and the people who operate them. Metal → Services accessible at perimeter + people who can access them (social engineering) |
