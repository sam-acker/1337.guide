Seems pretty simple. You go to the website! Yes... but what about every step in-between?

| Step                   | Location          | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Related Technologies                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User Input             | user endpoint     | You start by typing a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address bar of your web browser. This URL typically includes the protocol (http:// or https://) and the domain name of the website you want to visit.                                                                  | - Browser                                                                                                                                   |
| DNS Resolution         | network           | The browser needs to find the IP address associated with the domain name. It sends a Domain Name System (DNS) query to a DNS server (usually provided by your Internet Service Provider or a public DNS server like Google's 8.8.8.8) to resolve the domain name into an IP address. | - DNS (port 53)                                                                                                                             |
| DNS Server Query       | network           | If the DNS server has the IP address cached, it returns the IP address to your browser. Otherwise, it queries other DNS servers recursively until it finds the IP address. The DNS response includes a time-to-live (TTL) value indicating how long the IP address can be cached.    |                                                                                                                                             |
| TCP/IP                 | network           | Your browser initiates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to the IP address obtained from DNS. This is done through a series of steps called the TCP handshake, which involves SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets exchanged between your browser and the web server.        |                                                                                                                                             |
| HTTP                   | network           | Once the TCP connection is established, your browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the web server. The request includes information like the method (GET, POST, etc.), headers, and the specific resource (path) you're requesting.                         |                                                                                                                                             |
| Web Server Processing  | provider endpoint | The web server receives the HTTP request. It processes the request, determines the appropriate response, and locates the requested resource on the server's file system or through other means (e.g., database queries).                                                             | - Web Servers: nginx, apache, node.js, IIS                                                                                                  |
| Server Side Processing | provider endpoint | If the requested resource is dynamic (e.g., a PHP script or a database-driven page), the server-side code is executed to generate the content. This can involve retrieving data from a database, performing calculations, or generating HTML content.                                | - Backend runtimes: javascript(node, express), python(django, flask), java(spring), php(laravel), .NET(ASP) - Containerization: Docker, LXC |
| Response               | network           | The server generates an HTTP response that includes a response status, headers, and the content of the requested resource. The response can also include cookies, caching directives, and other metadata.                                                                            |                                                                                                                                             |
| Rendering              | user endpoint     | Your browser receives the HTTP response and processes the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets to render the webpage. It interprets the HTML structure, styles the content using CSS, and executes JavaScript to add interactivity.                                               | - HTML - javascript                                                                                                                         |
